Project 1:
Scenario1: 
The keywords: API, building a program, GO..
The queries:
1.	What is an API and how does it work?
2.	How to build an API?
3.	What is Golang?
4.	Connect to API in Golang(GO)?
The sets:
SET1:
1.	Database:  MySQL: stores data in tables and rows, can handle complicated querying(in the case of e commerce website, can handle the transactions) 
2.	Operating system: Windows:  affordable, flexible for hardware, famous and has a strong community. Would use visual studio code as an IDE: offers powerful; html, css javascript and JSON editors
3.	Language: Golang for backend since kidzie already uses Go language and wants to connect with Moneris API.
4.	Frontend I would use Angular: features: components, services, subscribing to data streams called observables, creating your own pipes. MVC framework
5.	Libraries: 
•	bootstrap:  lightweight and customizable, responsive structures and styles, good documentation and community support
•	sweetAlert: is it a standalone library that replaces the javascripts window. It is made of javascript file plus css file. Great UI
SET2: I would only change to using Influxdb since it uses an SQL like language(relational database) for the same reason of storing data and handling complicated queries

Scenario2:
Queries: 
1.	How to choose the right mobile app database for your app?
2.	What is an example of unstructured data?
3.	Why mongodb is good for unstructured data?
4.	How to handle news from channels in the database? 
5.	Why java is preferred for developing android apps?
6.	what are the libraries you use in developing an android application for a radio channel?
7.	build your application as android or ios

The sets:
Set1:
Database: 
I would use Mongodb:
•	schema-less JSON document database, known for its flexibility and scalability to store the unstructured data(the live radio feed)(server side). 
it is considered fast when it comes to handling a large volume of unstructured data. 
it offers network encryption and can pass through disk encryption to help protect the database and communications(SSL is a standard technology used for encrypting network traffic)
Concerning the news of what is happening in the country, I would use SQLite since it has built in Open Helper tool to check database versions. (since we are going to update our database constantly) 
Operating system: Windows, Android studio:
1.	different ways to make money: 
a.	Although downloading the application is for free, we can make the upgrade of the application paid, and can include advertisements and in-app purchases(since android users dominate the market place )
2.	We can use the drag and drop feature in android studio
3.	Android studio uses modules to organize the code.
Programming language: Java:
 open source and there is a big community that uses java,  being a platform independent , the applications developed using Java can be deployed on any platform, it is an object-oriented language with much flexibility. 
Libraries: 
Radiojar: realtime chat with listeners, monthly and weekly analytics report
Set2:
Flutter: 
1.	creates a cross platform application.
2.	Dart java like language.
3.	Everything has a widget for it.
4.	Easy to work with.
Scenario3: 
Queries: 
1.	why using django? 
2.	customize permissions for users in Django
3.	how django handles authorization APIs?
4.	Why using Pycharm for python and not visual studio code?
Database: Django (python framework): we can customize authentication in django (to separate between users) flexibility in detecting the users’ permissions
Operating system: windows/ Pycharm:  special IDE for python, works perfectly with autocomplete for python 
Languages: 
For the frontend,  Javascript, html, CSS, essentials for building webpages, also js comes handy when working with ajax
back-end: python since I want to use the features that Django framework offers, and it is a python framework
Libraries: bootstrap:  lightweight and customizable, responsive structures and styles, good documentation and community support
